# ADA Presidential Election Prediction
This project was completed in the 2020 2nd semester for the Advanced Data Analysis class.

The question I tried to answer was: Which candidate will win the 2020 presidential election?

Through the collection, cleaning, and sentimental analysis of twitter tweets that contained #Trump and #Biden prior to the presidential election, I was able to correctly predict that Joe Biden would win the 2020 presidential election.
